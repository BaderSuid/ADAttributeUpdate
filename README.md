# ADAttributeUpdate
Uses Automated Export Services (AES) reports generated by ADP as the source of truth that all changes are based on. This script can detect changes in user's Active Directory attributes (Ex. Job title, manager, department, etc.) and commit those changes while auditing them for future reference. It also creates accounts for new users in a disabled state with all its attributes imported. Accounts that are on leave get disabled, accounts returning from leave get reenabled, and accounts that are terminated get automatically offboarded and an archive of their account properties gets created.
